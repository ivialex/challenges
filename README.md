# WordPress

WordPress development with Docker and Docker Compose.

I used this projects in my WordPress development:

- [WordPress and WP CLI](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)
- [phpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/)
- [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)

## Requirements

Make sure you have the latest versions of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.

Clone this repository or copy the files from this repository into a new folder. In the **docker-compose.yml** file you may change the IP address, Port for the Host and Port to the Container. 

## Configuration

Change the environment file `.env`

Edit the `.env` file to change it:

* `IP address`
* `WordPress Host Port`
* `WordPress Container Port`
* `MySQL IP address`
* `MySQL Root User`
* `MySQL Root Password`
* `MySQL Database Name`
* `MySQL Host Port`
* `MySQL Container Port`
* `PMA Port`
* `PMA Host Port`
* `PMA Container Port`

## Installation

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

The containers are now built and running. You should be able to access the WordPress installation with the configured IP in the browser address. By default it is `http://127.0.0.1`.

For convenience you may add a new entry into your hosts file.

## Usage

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker-compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the`down` command:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

### Developing a Plugin

Configure the volume to load the plugin in the container in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```
volumes:
  - ./<path for the plugin>/:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name
```

### WP CLI

The docker compose configuration also provides a service for using the [WordPress CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).

Sample command to install WordPress:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli core install --url=http://localhost --title=test --admin_user=admin --admin_email=test@example.com
```

Or to list installed plugins:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli plugin list
```

For an easier usage you may consider adding an alias for the CLI:

```
alias wp="docker-compose run --rm wpcli"
```

This way you can use the CLI command above as follows:

```
wp plugin list
```

### phpMyAdmin

You can also visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to access phpMyAdmin after starting the containers.

The default username is `root`, and the password is the same as supplied in the `.env` file.
